# Playing-card-cryptography
Project for Object-oriented Programming and Software Engineering (CITS1001) @ UWA

While perusing the library’s copy of Donald Knuth’s The Art of Computer Programming one evening, a sheet of paper between two pages falls out. Looking at it, you discover that it contains an encrypted message, and instructions for a cryptosystem, Pontoon, for decrypting it. The cryptosystem is designed so that it can be implemented using a deck of playing cards – but, not having a deck of cards to hand, you decide to implement it in Java.
